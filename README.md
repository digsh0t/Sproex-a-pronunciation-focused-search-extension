## Note

- Due to the $5 fee to create an account to publish my extension on the Google Web Store, I decided not to make this extension available there and only offer it here. You can find the installation instructions below.
- This extension is currently only tested on Google Chrome and was developed in just two days over the weekend, so it may contain errors. Please feel free to create an Issue if you encounter any problems. And please do not judge my frontend skills, they are not the best.

## Installation

- Clone or download the code to your local machine and extract it.
  - For non-tech users, scroll up this page and you will see a green button labeled `Code`. Click on it and select the option `Download ZIP`. Once the ZIP file is downloaded to your machine, extract it and remember the path to it.
- Open Google Chrome.
- Click on the three dots in the upper-right corner.
- Select More tools and then Extensions.
- If you have not enabled `Developer mode`, enable it by toggling the switch on the top right corner. This is necessary to import the extension.
- You should now see a menu with the option `Load unpacked`. Click on this option and navigate to the extracted folder.
- If you see the message `Extension loaded`, congratulations, you have successfully installed the extension.

## Usage

- To use the extension, simply double-click on any word you want to search and right-click. An option called `Search by Cambridge Dictionary` will appear.
- Click on it, and a popup will appear with the information you need.
- Click the `Close` button or click outside of the popup to close it. It's that simple!
