## Note

Due to the $5 fee just to create an account to publish my extension on Google Web Store, I decided not to make this extension available on it and only through here. The installation is right below.

## Installation

- Pull the code to your local machine then extract it
  - For non-tech, scroll up this page, you will see a green button named `Code`, click it, there will be an option called `Download as Zip`. Click it and there will be a Zip file downloaded into your machine, extract it and remember the path to it.
- Open up your Chrome
- Click on the 3 dot, it is in the right corner on top.
- Select `More tools` then select suboption `Extensions`
- If you have not enabled `Developer mode`, enable it by switch on the option on the top right corner. This is needed to import our extension.
- By then, you will see a menu appear with option `Load unpacked`, click on this and navigate to the extracted folder.
- If it said `Extension loaded`, congratulations you have finished the installation phase.

## Usage

- By now, just double click on any word you want to search and right click, there will be an option called `Search by Cambridge Dictionary`.
- Click on it, a popup will appear with the information you need.
- Click the Close button or outside of the popup to close it. Simple right?
